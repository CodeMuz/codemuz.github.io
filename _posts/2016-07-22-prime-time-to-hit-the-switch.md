title: Prime time to hit the switch
---
If you have a few hours to spare and an Arduino Uno lying around, here's a fun game I made that challenges your ability to factorize numbers and I'll show you how to make one too.

The aim of the game is to correctly guess whether a number is prime or not. 

A prime number is a whole number greater than 1, whose only two whole-number factors are 1 and itself.

VIDEO HERE

To begin a number is displayed on the screen and you are presented with the option to select 'yes' or 'no'. The question is simply: 'Is this number a Prime number or not?'.

The screen also displays your score so you can challenge yourself or your friends and family.

## How to build this yourself

To build this circuit, with or without a breadboard, the components you'll need are:
- Arduino UNO (used revision 3)
- Potentiometer
- Two Switches for input controls, any type you feel like is ok I used push-to-make buttons
- Any analog input (Capacitor, potentiometer, temp sensors or photo-resistors are all great)
- Any LCD display (at least 16 x 2) I used [LCM1602C]
- You can power it from 9v battery or USB cable.

The circuit looks as follows:

For you to play around with I've prototyped the board using circuits.io [here](https://circuits.io/circuits/2458049-prime-number-guesser)

The source code is available to [download](https://github.com/CodeMuz/arduino-projects/blob/master/Extra/Prime_Number_Game/primegame.ino) from github under CC BY SA 3.0.

An interesting things to note in the source code is the random number generator code:

~~~
/*
Returns an odd integer between 0 and maxNumber
*/
unsigned long generateNewNumber() {

  unsigned long n = random(11 * analogRead(seedPin)) % maxNumber;
  
  //bias distribution to return higher percent composite
  if(n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0 || n == 1 || n == prevNumber){
    return generateNewNumber();  
  }
  
  prevNumber = n;

  return n;
}
~~~

Firstly I'm using the usigned long data type as that holds 4 bytes of positive numbers (0 to 4,294,967,295), this is because prime numbers are by definition positive numbers and a long allows the game to generate larger numbers if required. For speed with primality test and to reduce difficulty I've set the max to the 5th Mersenne Prime 8191.

The analogue input device is required to provide more random information to the arduino _random_ function when generating the prime numbers. There's also a check so that the same number does not appear twice as this would be sub optimal for a quiz type game.

The Primality test function is just a naive implementation which is practical for small numbers and tests all the potential prime factors up to the square root of n.

~~~
boolean isPrime(long n) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return false;
  } else if (n <= 3 ) {
    return true;
  } else if (n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0) {
    return false;
  }
  int i = 5;
  while ((i * i) <= n) {
    if (n % i == 0 || n % (i + 2) == 0) {
      return false;
    }
    i = i + 6;
  }
  return true;
}
~~~

A better approach would be using the deterministic [Baillieâ€“PSW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baillie%E2%80%93PSW_primality_test).

Running the circuit on 10,000 numbers for 6,421ms generates 3796 primes indicating that if you were to select 'No' every answer you would have a 62.04% rate of success.
