I rememeber the excitement when learning how logic gates and flip flops work in school, it's been a while since then so decided to try re-kindle the magic by learning how to program Arduino. I originally chose the Raspberry Pi to learn but it only became a proxy for our media hub, therefore I'm deciding to go down the microelectronics route and adopt an unsuspecting [Arduino Uno](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoStarterKit) (_recomended for entry level and with the starter kit which includes hundreds of LEDs, resistors, capacitors, a breadboard, jump wires, battery snaps etc_).

To revise some basic electronics:

Resistence _R_ is measured in Ohms
Potential difference _V_ is measured in Volts
Current _I_ is measured in Amps

Ohm's law states _V = I * R_ 

## Circuits in Series

* Voltage is **different** accross components
* Current is the **same** accross components

Vtotal = V1 + V2 + V3
Itotal = I1 = I2 = I3
Rtotal = R1 + R2 + R3

## Circuits in  Parallel

* Voltage is the **same** accross branches
* Current is the **different** accross branches

Vtotal = V1 + V2 + V3
Itotal = I1 = I2 = I3
1/Rtotal = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3

the voltage from the battery provides charge, imagine the charge of the circuit channeling itself like a liquid via different routes depending on how much resistence it faces. If components are connected along a single wire (series) then the level of charge is constant as there is only one path. If there are multiple routes then the charge favours route with less obstacles (resistence), but of course some will still flow through other routes to ground.

The electrons in the circuit flow from ground to high voltage as they are negatively charged.
